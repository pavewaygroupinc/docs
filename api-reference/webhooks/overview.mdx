Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about events in your PaveWay account. When an event occurs (e.g., a payment succeeds or an eSIM is provisioned), PaveWay sends an HTTP POST request to your configured webhook endpoint.

## Configuration

You can configure your webhook endpoints in the **Business Dashboard**.

1.  **URL**: Must be an `https://` endpoint.
2.  **Events**: Select the specific events you want to listen to (e.g., `payment.succeeded`).
3.  **Secret**: PaveWay provides a **Signing Secret** (`whsec_...`) for each endpoint to verify request authenticity.

## Common Event Types

| Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `payment.succeeded` | Triggered when a PaymentIntent status changes to `succeeded`. |
| `payment.failed` | Triggered when a payment attempt fails. |
| `order.completed` | Triggered when an eSIM or other financial service order is successfully provisioned. |
| `payout.failed` | Triggered if a scheduled payout to your bank/wallet fails. |

## Retry Policy

If your server returns anything other than a `2xx` status code, PaveWay will retry the notification with exponential backoff:

- Retries occur up to 10 times over 24 hours.
- If an endpoint fails consistently for 7 days, it will be automatically disabled.

## Receiving a Webhook

Your endpoint should be prepared to handle a POST request with a JSON body.

```json
{
  "event_type": "payment.succeeded",
  "business_id": "bus_123...",
  "resource_type": "transaction",
  "resource_id": "658dc...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "data": {
    "id": "658dc...",
    "payment_ref": "PWG_abc123",
    "amount": "5000",
    "currency": "XAF",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "customer": {
        "email": "customer@example.com"
    },
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should always verify the signature of the webhook before processing the payload. See our [Signature Verification](/api-reference/webhooks/verification) guide.

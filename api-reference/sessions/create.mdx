Customer sessions allow you to create a temporary, authenticated context for a customer. This is commonly used to let customers manage their own payment methods or view their billing history in your application without exposing your Secret Keys.

### Authentication
Include your **Secret Key** in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_...
```

### Request Body

<ParamField body="customer_email" type="string" required>
  The email address of the customer to create a session for.
</ParamField>

### Response

Returns a `session_token` which can be used in client-side requests for a limited time (default 30 minutes).

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Session created successfully",
  "data": {
    "session_token": "cs_AbCdEf...",
    "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
    "expires_at": "2024-01-01T12:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Validate a Session

Check if a session token is still valid.

```bash
POST /v1/sessions/validate
-H "Authorization: Bearer cs_AbCdEf..."
```

## Revoke a Session

Explicitly terminate a session (Logout).

```bash
POST /v1/sessions/revoke
-H "Authorization: Bearer cs_AbCdEf..."
```

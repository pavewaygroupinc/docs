PaveWay's Subscription API allows you to charge customers on a recurring basis (monthly, weekly, or daily). We support both card-based auto-billing and mobile-money scheduled prompts.

## Key Concepts

- **Plans**: Define the logic for your subscription (amount, currency, billing cycle).
- **Subscriptions**: The link between a customer and a plan.
- **Invoices**: Generated automatically for each billing period.
- **Fallback Payment Methods**: Automatically switch to an alternative (e.g., from Mobile Money to Card) if the primary method fails.

## Payment Methods

| Method | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cards** | Automatic charges using saved Stripe or Flutterwave tokens. |
| **Mobile Money** | Scheduled USSD prompts sent to the customer's phone at their **Preferred Time**. |

## Billing Cycle

PaveWay supports the following billing cycles:
- `daily`: Billed every 24 hours.
- `weekly`: Billed every 7 days.
- `monthly`: Billed once a month.

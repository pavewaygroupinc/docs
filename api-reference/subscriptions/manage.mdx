PaveWay provides endpoints to modify, pause, or cancel active subscriptions.

## Pause & Resume

Pause billing for a customer without canceling their plan.

```bash
POST /subscriptions/{id}/pause 
POST /subscriptions/{id}/resume
```

## Update Payment Method

Switch a customer from Mobile Money to Card, or update their billing phone number.

```bash
PUT /subscriptions/{id}/payment-method
```

## Cancel Subscription

```bash
POST /subscriptions/{id}/cancel
```

### Cancellation Parameters

<ParamField body="immediately" type="boolean" default="false">
  If `true`, billing stops now. If `false`, the subscription remains active until the end of the current period.
</ParamField>

## Fallback Configuration

Configure a secondary payment method (e.g., a credit card) to be tried automatically if the primary mobile money payment fails after $X$ attempts.

```bash
PUT /subscriptions/{id}/fallback
```

<ParamField body="trigger_after_failures" type="integer" default="3">
  Number of consecutive failures before falling back to the secondary method.
</ParamField>

Welcome to the PaveWay Developer Portal. Our platform enables businesses to integrate seamless local and global payment collections, as well as resell value-added services like eSIMs and Airtime.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using our APIs, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1.  **Create a Business**: Sign up and create your business profile on the [PaveWay Business Portal](https://business.pavewaygroup.com).
2.  **Enable 2FA**: For security, you must enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) under the **Security** tab in your [PaveWay Account](https://myaccount.pavewaygroup.com).
3.  **Generate API Keys**: Once 2FA is enabled, navigate to the **API Settings** in your [PaveWay Account](https://myaccount.pavewaygroup.com) to generate your **Secret Key**, **Public Key**, and **Webhook Secret**.

Once you have your keys, you can proceed to the [Authentication](/authentication) guide.

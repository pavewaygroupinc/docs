PaveWay supports mobile integrations via direct API calls or our specialized mobile SDKs.

## Direct API (Custom UI)

If you prefer to build your own UI, you can confirm payments directly from your backend after collecting the user's mobile money number or high-level transaction intent.

## SDK Support

We offer official SDKs for:
- **Flutter** (Active Development)
- **React Native** (Coming Soon)
- **Native Android/iOS** (Coming Soon)

Please contact your account manager for early access to the Flutter SDK.

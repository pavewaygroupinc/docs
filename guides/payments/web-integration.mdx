The fastest way to accept payments on the web is using **PaveWay Checkout**, our pre-built, hosted payment page.

## How it Works

1.  **Create an Intent**: Generate a `client_secret` on your server.
2.  **Redirect**: Send the customer to `[checkout_url] https://checkout.pavewaygroup.com/initpay/{id}?client_secret={pki...}`.
3.  **Return**: The customer is redirected back to your `redirect_url` once the payment is complete.

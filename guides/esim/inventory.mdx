The PaveWay eSIM API allows you to browse hundreds of data plans across the globe. You can filter by country, continent, or search for global plans that work everywhere.

## Browsing Packages

### 1. By Country
To see eSIMs available in a specific country, first fetch the list of supported countries.

```bash
# Get all supported countries
curl https://api.pavewaygroup.com/v1/esim/countries \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..."
```

Then, query the packages for a given country code:

```bash
# Get packages for Cameroon (CM)
curl https://api.pavewaygroup.com/v1/esim/countries/CM/packages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..."
```

### 2. By Continent
If you want to offer regional plans (e.g., "All Africa" or "Europe"), you can browse by continent.

```bash
# Get packages for Africa
curl https://api.pavewaygroup.com/v1/esim/continents/africa/packages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..."
```

### 3. Global Plans
PaveWay also offers global eSIMs that work in 100+ countries.

```bash
# List all global packages
curl https://api.pavewaygroup.com/v1/esim/global \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..."
```

## Package Details

Each package object contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the plan.
- `data_limit`: Amount of data (e.g., 1GB, 5GB).
- `validity`: Duration (e.g., 7 days, 30 days).
- `price`: Cost in your base currency.
- `coverage`: List of countries where it works.

PaveWay's subscription engine allows you to automate billing for your customers. This guide covers how to set up recurring payments using both Mobile Money and Cards.

## How it Works

1.  **Define a Plan**: Create a plan that defines the price, currency, and billing interval (daily, weekly, monthly).
2.  **Choose a Payment Method**:
    - **Card**: Uses a saved token from a previous payment to charge the customer automatically.
    - **Mobile Money**: Sends a USSD prompt to the customer's phone at a **Preferred Time** (e.g., 6 PM daily).
3.  **Subscribe the Customer**: Create a subscription object linking the customer to the plan.
4.  **Automatic Invoicing**: PaveWay generates invoices and attempts collection automatically according to the cycle.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Create a Subscription Plan
Use the [Plans API](/api-reference/subscriptions/plans) to define your tiers.

```bash
POST /v1/subscriptions/plans
{
  "name": "Standard Monthly",
  "code": "std-mth",
  "amount": 5000,
  "billing_cycle": "monthly"
}
```

### 2. Set Up the Primary Payment Method

#### Card Subscriptions
To use card-based auto-pay, you must first have a saved `card_token` from a successful [PaymentIntent](/api-reference/payments/create-intent) where `setup_future_usage` was enabled.

#### Mobile Money Subscriptions
Mobile money subscriptions don't require pre-authorization. You just need the customer's phone number and their preferred window for receiving payment prompts.

```json
"preferred_time": {
  "hour": 18,
  "minute": 0,
  "timezone": "Africa/Douala"
}
```

### 3. Handle Ongoing Subscriptions
Use [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks/overview) to listen for `invoice.paid` or `subscription.canceled` events. 

> [!TIP]
> Always configure a **Fallback Payment Method**. If a mobile money prompt fails (e.g., customer has no funds), PaveWay can automatically attempt to charge a secondary card if defined.

## Managing Lifecycle
- **Pausing**: Stop billing temporarily (e.g., during a service outage).
- **Grace Periods**: Configured in your dashboard to allow retries before cancellation.
- **Upgrades/Downgrades**: Update the `plan_id` on the subscription object.

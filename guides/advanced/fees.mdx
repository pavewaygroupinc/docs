PaveWay provides a transparent fee engine that calculates costs in real-time based on the payment method, customer location, and merchant configuration.

## Fee Types

| Fee Type | Description | Standard Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Platform Fee** | PaveWay's processing fee. | 1.0% |
| **Provider Fee** | Passthrough cost from the gateway (Stripe, Flutterwave, etc.). | Varies by country (1.4% - 4.8%) |
| **Fixed Fee** | A flat cost per transaction. | 50 XAF (Local MM) / $0.30 (Intl Cards) |

## Fee Bearer Configuration

You can control who pays the transaction fees using the `fee_bearer` parameter at [PaymentIntent creation](/api-reference/payments/create-intent).

- **`merchant`**: Fees are deducted from your final payout. The customer pays exactly the amount you specify.
- **`customer`** (Default): Fees are added to the transaction amount. The customer sees a slightly higher total at checkout, but you receive the full requested amount.

## Fetching a Quote

You can retrieve a real-time fee breakdown before charging the customer.

```bash
GET /v1/payment-methods/fee/{payment_method}/{currency}/{amount}
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "XAF",
    "fee": 350,
    "total_payable": 10350
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> For high-volume merchants, the **Platform Fee** is reduced to **0.5%**. Contact your account manager for tiered pricing.

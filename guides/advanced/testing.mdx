PaveWay provides a robust test environment where you can simulate successful and failed payments without moving any real money.

## Test Environment

- **Dashboard**: Use the "Test Mode" toggle in your Merchant Dashboard to view test transactions.
- **Sandbox URL**: `https://api-sandbox.pavewaygroup.com/v1`
- **Authentication**: All requests to the sandbox must use your `sk_test_...` key.

## Test Payment Methods

### Cards

Use the following cards to test different scenarios:

| Card Number | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Success (Any CVV / Future Date) |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Insufficient Funds (Simulates 402 Error) |
| `4000 0000 0000 0005` | 3D-Secure Required (Triggers OTP Modal) |

### Mobile Money

Simulate prompts by providing specific phone number patterns:

| Phone Number | Network | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `237600000001` | MTN | Success after 10s delay. |
| `237600000002` | ORANGE | Immediate Success. |
| `237600000003` | MTN | Insufficient Funds (Failure). |

## Simulating Webhooks

You can use the **Webhook Tester** in your dashboard to send mock events to your server. This allows you to verify your [Signature Verification](/api-reference/webhooks/verification) logic without making an actual API call.

> [!TIP]
> Use a tool like **ngrok** or **https://webhook.site** to tunnel your local server to a public URL so it can receive PaveWay's test webhooks during development.

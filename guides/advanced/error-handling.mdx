description: "Understand PaveWay's error codes and how to handle them gracefully."
---

PaveWay uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:
- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.).
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with PaveWay's servers.

## internal Error Object

When an error occurs, the response body will contain a standardized `error` object.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "parameter_invalid",
    "message": "The 'amount' field must be a positive integer.",
    "param": "amount",
    "request_id": "req_abc123"
  }
}
```

### Attributes

  For some errors that could be handled programmatically, a short string indicating the error code reported.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>

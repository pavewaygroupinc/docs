PaveWay uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can manage your API keys in the Business Dashboard.

## Getting Your Keys

To protect your business data, PaveWay requires a few security steps before keys can be issued:

1.  **Register your Business**: Complete your KYC and business setup on the [Business Portal](https://business.pavewaygroup.com).
2.  **Secure your Account**: Head to **Settings > Security** and enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**.
3.  **Reveal Keys**: Go to **Developers > API Keys**. Your Secret Keys will only be displayed once—make sure to store them in a secure environment variable or vault.

## Key Types

PaveWay provides three types of keys to handle different integration scenarios:

| Key Type | Prefix | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Secret Key** | `sk_...` | Used for server-to-server API calls. Keep this secure! |
| **Public Key** | `pk_...` | Used in client-side SDKs. Never expose this key in client-side code. |
| **Webhook Secret** | `whsec_...` | Used to verify that events sent to your server are from PaveWay. |

## Environments

PaveWay provides two distinct environments to ensure you can build and test safely.

### Switching Environments

To toggle between environments, you must update two things in your code:
1.  **The API Key**: Use your `sk_test_...` key for testing and your `sk_live_...` key for production.
2.  **The Base URL**:
    - **Live**: `https://api.pavewaygroup.com/v1`
    - **Test**: `https://api-sandbox.pavewaygroup.com/v1`

| Environment | Key Prefix | Base URL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sandbox (Test)** | `sk_test_` | `https://api-sandbox.pavewaygroup.com/v1` |
| **Production (Live)** | `sk_live_` | `https://api.pavewaygroup.com/v1` |

## Including Keys in Requests

For server-side requests (Secret Keys), include your key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

```bash
curl https://api.pavewaygroup.com/v1/payment-intents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_your_secret_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

### X-API-KEY Header (Legacy/Alternative)

Some endpoints also support the custom `x-api-key` header for cases where Bearer authentication is not suitable:

```http
x-api-key: sk_test_your_secret_key_here
```

## Rate Limiting

To ensure API stability, PaveWay enforces rate limits on all endpoints. Limits are applied per API key and per IP address.

- **Standard Endpoints**: 60 requests per minute.
- **Payment Creation**: 20 requests per minute.
- **Card Tokenization**: 10 requests per minute.

If you exceed these limits, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error. If you require higher limits for your production application, please contact our support team.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never share your Secret Keys or include them in client-side code (browsers, mobile apps). If a key is compromised, rotate it immediately in the Business Dashboard.
